William Neal AmplifyAutomation QA Example for Interview.


Alright so basic overview, I am doing a small short demo of some test automation for Amplify 
I made an NUnit 3 test project 

_______________________________________________________________________________
In my console I used the following commands

Install-Package Selenium.WebDriver - This is grabbing selenium

Install-Package Selenium.WebDriver.ChromeDriver - This is my actual web driver
________________________________________________________________________________

Install-Package SpecFlow.NUnit
Install-Package SpecFlow.Tools.MsBuild.Generation

This is for the gherkin I intend to use later

_________________________________________________________________________________

Install-Package NUnit3TestAdapter

This is just an adapter so the project will run

_________________________________________________________________________________

Alright cool looks like we are set up here. Console is showing everything installed just fine.

Next piece I did was build out my folders, I am doing a simple
Drivers/Features/Locators/SD's and Utils set up.
This is just a sample not a full blow automation set up

_________________________________________________________________________________

Tried to do commit but ran into some issues with git

Built out git ignore .txt but still was getting error:

Git failed with a fatal error.
error: open(".vs/Amplify.NETQA/FileContentIndex/39ac97b9-e9d3-41e0-be22-815128ee29aa.vsidx"): Permission denied
fatal: Unable to process path .vs/Amplify.NETQA/FileContentIndex/39ac97b9-e9d3-41e0-be22-815128ee29aa.vsidx 

Decided to migrate to github desktop to help mitigate issue

_________________________________________________________________________________

Github desktop helped briefly but ultimately doesn't integrate well with 2022 community. works much better on enterprise for some reason

_________________________________________________________________________________

Alright spending some time throwing together a quick config file, my first step definitions page, a data helper and some wait
helpers so I dont need to throw thread.sleeps everywhere
