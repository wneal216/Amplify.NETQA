William Neal AmplifyAutomation QA Example for Interview.


Alright so basic overview, I am doing a small short demo of some test automation for Amplify 
I made an NUnit 3 test project 

_______________________________________________________________________________
In my console I used the following commands

Install-Package Selenium.WebDriver - This is grabbing selenium

Install-Package Selenium.WebDriver.ChromeDriver - This is my actual web driver
________________________________________________________________________________

Install-Package SpecFlow.NUnit
Install-Package SpecFlow.Tools.MsBuild.Generation

This is for the gherkin I intend to use later

_________________________________________________________________________________

Install-Package NUnit3TestAdapter

This is just an adapter so the project will run

_________________________________________________________________________________

Alright cool looks like we are set up here. Console is showing everything installed just fine.

Next piece I did was build out my folders, I am doing a simple
Drivers/Features/Locators/SD's and Utils set up.
This is just a sample not a full blow automation set up
